                    <h2>French Press</h2>
                    <p>The French press is a classic, full-immersion brewing method. Coarse coffee grounds are steeped in hot water for about 4 minutes, then separated by pressing down a metal or plastic plunger through a mesh sieve.</p>

                    <h2>Pour Over</h2>
                    <p>The pour over method involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds in a filter. The water drains through the coffee and filter into a carafe or mug. This method allows for control over the brewing time and water temperature. Pour over brewing highlights the intricate flavors and aromas of the coffee, making it a favorite among coffee enthusiasts. It requires a bit of patience and precision, but the result is a clean and flavorful cup. Using a gooseneck kettle can improve pouring accuracy, while experimenting with different grind sizes and water-to-coffee ratios can help achieve the perfect brew. This method is ideal for those who enjoy the ritual and craftsmanship of making coffee.</p>

                    <h2>Aeropress</h2>
                    <p>The Aeropress uses air pressure to push water through coffee grounds. This method produces a concentrated coffee similar to espresso, which can be diluted with water or milk. Its quick brewing process, typically under two minutes, makes it a favorite for those on the go. The Aeropress is also highly portable and easy to clean, making it an excellent choice for traveling or camping. Its versatility allows for various brewing techniques, from a strong, short shot to a smooth, longer coffee. Additionally, the paper filter used in the Aeropress helps to reduce bitterness and ensure a clean cup every time. Coffee enthusiasts appreciate its ability to extract rich flavors while minimizing acidity.</p>

                    <h2>Espresso</h2>
                    <p>Espresso is made by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans. This method produces a thick, strong coffee with a layer of crema on top. It's the base for many popular coffee drinks, such as lattes, cappuccinos, and Americanos.</p>

                    <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
                    <p>Cold brew is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in cold water for an extended period (usually 12 hours or more). The result is a smooth, less acidic coffee that can be served cold or hot. This method of brewing highlights the natural sweetness and subtle flavors of the coffee beans, making it a refreshing and versatile beverage. Cold brew can be enjoyed on its own, over ice, or mixed with milk or flavored syrups for a customized drink. Additionally, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, providing a convenient and ready-to-drink option. The slow extraction process also results in a beverage that is lower in bitterness and can be easier on the stomach. Cold brew concentrate can also be used as a base for various coffee cocktails and desserts, adding a unique twist to traditional recipes. Perfect for hot summer days, cold brew offers a delightful alternative to hot coffee.</p>

                    <h2>Vietnamese Phin</h2>
                    <p>The Vietnamese Phin is a traditional method which uses a small metal drip filter that sits atop a cup. Coarse coffee grounds are placed in the filter, hot water is poured over, and the coffee slowly drips into the cup below. This produces a strong and robust coffee often enjoyed with sweetened condensed milk.</p>
